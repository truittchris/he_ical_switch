/**
 *  iCal Calendar Switch (Hub TZ)
 *
 *  A lightweight Hubitat driver that maps calendar activity to a virtual switch.
 *
 *  Behavior:
 *   - Subscribes to a public iCal / ICS calendar feed
 *   - Evaluates events using the Hubitat hub’s configured timezone
 *   - Turns the switch ON when an eligible event is active
 *   - Turns the switch OFF when no eligible event is active
 *   - Schedules precise transitions at event start/end to avoid polling drift
 *
 *  Design goals:
 *   - Correct timezone handling (UTC, TZID, calendar-level timezone hints)
 *   - Reliable behavior with Outlook / Microsoft 365 calendars
 *   - Predictable automation signal rather than full calendar UI
 *   - Minimal configuration with sensible defaults
 *
 *  Intended use:
 *   - Virtual switch for Rule Machine and other automations
 *   - “In meeting” or “busy time” indicators
 *   - Input signal for dashboards or mode changes
